# Production Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Code Quality & Performance
- [x] Removed console.log statements from production code
- [x] Removed unused imports and variables
- [x] Fixed ESLint warnings for production build
- [x] Added proper environment configuration
- [x] Created logger utility for production logging

## ‚úÖ Environment Configuration
- [x] Created `.env.production` with production API URLs
- [x] Created `.env.development` for development settings
- [x] Disabled source maps in production (`GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`)
- [x] Added build optimization scripts

## ‚úÖ Security & Best Practices
- [x] Removed debug information from error messages
- [x] Cleaned up development-only code sections
- [x] Added proper error boundaries
- [x] Implemented production-ready logging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Tasks Required
- [ ] Update `.env.production` with your actual production API URL
- [ ] Test build with `npm run build:prod`
- [ ] Set up error monitoring service (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up production server with proper SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure domain and DNS settings

## üìä Build Commands
```bash
# Development build
npm start

# Production build
npm run build:prod

# Analyze bundle size
npm run build:analyze

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps
1. Update environment variables in `.env.production`
2. Run `npm run build:prod` to create optimized build
3. Upload `build/` directory to your web server
4. Configure server to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA)
5. Set up proper caching headers for static assets
6. Monitor application performance and errors

## üìà Performance Optimizations Applied
- Lazy loading for better initial load times
- Proper React.memo usage for component optimization
- Bundle analysis for size monitoring
- Source map disabled in production for faster builds
- Environment-specific configurations

## üîí Security Measures
- API endpoints configured via environment variables
- No sensitive data hardcoded in the application
- Proper error handling without exposing internal details
- Production logging configured for security monitoring
